# Virginia Child Care Facilities Server

What is this project?
------
Working with David Moore from Smart Beginnings NRV, we are working on developing a useful website for exploring data around child care facilities in Virginia. The current [Virginia Department of Social Services](https://www.dss.virginia.gov/facility/search/cc.cgi) (DSS) website includes limited ability to export and explore that data. This project is the server-side portion for providing a better interface to this data. See the [front-end](https://github.com/CodeforNRV/dss-virginia) repository as well.
* Python connecting to our PostgreSQL database

Status
------
Ongoing development with current deployment at http://codefornrv.github.io/dss-virginia
